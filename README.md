## About

This lab shows a few examples of how I think I could use generators and decorators at this point with my code. 
I can see how these two features of Python could have an immediate impact on the performance of my code.
I did not do any examples with dunder methods because I really can't think of any current use cases for them in my code.

There is a balance between concision and the clarity / readability of code and I think dunder methods could actually make my code less clear at this moment.
